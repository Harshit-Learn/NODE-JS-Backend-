# 📸 Image Uploader – Node.js + Express + Multer + Cloudinary

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a simple **backend API** built with **Node.js + Express** that allows users to upload images.
Instead of saving files locally, it uses **Cloudinary (cloud storage)** to securely store and serve images.
The **Multer middleware** is used to handle incoming file uploads from the client.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Node.js** – Server runtime
* **Express.js** – Web framework
* **Multer** – Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` (file uploads)
* **Cloudinary** – Cloud storage for media (images, videos, etc.)
* **Dotenv** – For environment variables

## 📌 Workflow

1. **Client** uploads image → `multipart/form-data`.
2. **Multer** parses the request and extracts the file.
3. File buffer is uploaded to **Cloudinary**.
4. Cloudinary returns a **secure URL**.
5. Server sends the URL back to the client.
